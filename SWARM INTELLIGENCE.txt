SWARM INTELLIGENCE

Swarm intelligence: two or more Individuals Independently collect information is processed through That social interaction and provides a solution to a problem cognitive That is not available to Individuals single.

This  phenomeno was first observed in animals, it is seen that they can achive more easly their goals and protect themselves against predators: such as a flock of birds, ant colonies to shoal of fishes. We look for an integration of the animals's SI work on groups of humans.

In humans there is not only interindividual variation in cognitive abilities but in some cases there are high performers Individuals that are by any standard "geniouses".It is true also that not all groups of animals or humans are SI but there is a potential for it.
SI is used mainly for making decitions or forecasting in modern society.Some times SI works when Individuals are concerned of what the context is and what we want to achieve in this case if we ask the Individuals to achieve a task: such as "to tell Â¿how many marbles are there in a jar "they will do it imprecisely but their guess can result in a close approximation in other cases SI may fail when there is an excel difference of knowledge between individuals, an example could be to ask the individuals" estimate how many times a coin needs to be tossed for the probability that the coin shows heads on all occasions " their guess is clearly devided for the Individuals who knows probability and the ones that does not.

There is also the notion of diversity in a group, in some studies Increased diversity was not beneficial to the group whereas in others to clear permormance advantage was found, this results are partly  owing to the fact That Differences in perspective can create communications barriers, and some of them depends on the respect for each other.
What is clear is that diversity of perspective is good for SI, but in some quantities, they can not  be so close to each other  because they would act as a single individual but it can not be so spaced because of the communication barriers .

We can conclude that SI performs well if there  is diversity of opinion, independence of opinion, an Initiative for truthful reporting, and if Individuals are only influenced by imprecision like the marble's problem and not by a systematic bias: such as the probability  problem.However despite the fact that there are some criteria for effective use of SI, there is lack of a baseline for this behavior.
